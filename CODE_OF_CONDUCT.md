# Contributor Covenant Code of Conduct

## Our Pledge

As members, contributors, and leaders, we pledge to make participation in our community a harassment-free experience for everyone, regardless of age, body size, visible or invisible disability, ethnicity, sex characteristics, gender identity and expression, level of experience, education, socio-economic status, nationality, personal appearance, race, religion, or sexual identity and orientation.

We pledge to act and interact in ways that contribute to an open, welcoming, diverse, inclusive, and healthy community.

## Our Standards

Examples of behavior that contribute to creating a positive environment in our community include:

* Demonstrating empathy and kindness towards others
* Respecting differing opinions, viewpoints, and experiences
* Providing and receiving constructive feedback gracefully
* Taking responsibility for our mistakes, apologizing to those affected, and learning from the experience
* Focusing on what is best for the overall community, not just for ourselves as individuals

Examples of unacceptable behavior include:

* Use of sexualized language or imagery, as well as sexual advances or attention of any kind
* Trolling, insulting, or derogatory comments, and personal or political attacks
* Harassment, whether public or private
* Publishing others' private information, such as physical or email addresses, without their explicit permission
* Any other conduct that could reasonably be considered inappropriate in a professional setting

## Enforcement Responsibilities

Community leaders are responsible for clarifying and enforcing our standards of acceptable behavior. They have the authority to take appropriate and fair corrective action in response to any behavior that they deem inappropriate, threatening, offensive, or harmful.

Community leaders have the right and responsibility to remove, edit, or reject comments, commits, code, wiki edits, issues, and other contributions that do not align with this Code of Conduct. They will communicate the reasons for moderation decisions when appropriate.

## Scope

This Code of Conduct applies within all community spaces and also applies when an individual is officially representing the community in public spaces. Examples of representing our community include using an official e-mail address, posting via an official social media account, or acting as an appointed representative at an online or offline event.

## Enforcement

Instances of abusive, harassing, or otherwise unacceptable behavior may be reported by contacting the community leaders responsible for enforcement at [contact-email].

All complaints will be reviewed and investigated promptly and fairly.

All community leaders are obligated to respect the privacy and security of the reporter of any incident.
